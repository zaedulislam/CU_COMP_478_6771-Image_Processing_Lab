# COMP 478/6771 - Image Processing (Winter 2022)
Lab materials for Winter 2022 COMP478/6771 - Image Processing course at Concordia University, Montreal.

This course was mainly about digital image fundamentals including:

- image transforms (Fourier, Haar, wavelet),
- Image Enhancement (histogram processing, spatial filtering, high- and low-pass filtering),
- image compression (elements of information theory, image compression models, error-free compression, lossy compression),
- image segmentation (line detection, Hough transform, edge detection and linking, thresholding, region splitting and merging), representation and description (chain codes, signatures, skeletons, shape descriptors, moments, texture).
- Image Restoration
- Feature Extration
